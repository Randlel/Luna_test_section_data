## Luna Test Section Data Management Plan

### Data Description
#### Measurement Types:
 + Point Temperature Measurements from Thermocouples (A numeric value of temperature over time per thermocouple)
 + Mass Flow Rate from a Coriolis Flow Meter (A numeric value of mass flow rate over time)
 + Pressure from a Pressure Transducer (A numeric value of pressure over time)
 + Power Applied to the Heated Area which is hand recorded from the Power Supply (A single set point for voltage and amperage (does not change with time))
 + 1D Temperature Array at test section wall (several thousand data point) from a Luna Fiber Optic Thermal Imaging System (An 1D array of temperature measurements over time) 
 
The point temperatures, mass flow rate, and pressure measurements are received by a DAQ. The data is then read into the computer by a software called LabView which records the data and saves it as an excel file. The power input is recorded by the experimentalist in a .txt file for each experiment. The Fiber Optic imaging will occur using a LUNA sensor. This sensor comes with software designed to read the signals from the fiber. The data is then saved as a .csv file.
